
Must do's
1.) Bring smart contract to the UniFr blockchain. Show that multiple users can update/validate on the same Blueprint. 
2.) Elaborate how to add the gasfees into our business model etc. 
3.) Adapt all our models (Business model, archi mate etc.)
4.) prepare presentation (6mins presentation, 4min demonstration)
Can do's:
1.) add own sub currency to our smart contract for payment besides the actual gas fees (code already here in the slides)
2.) fix the issue that on "getBlueprintHistory" only old versions are shown
3.) ~~make the visualization of returned values prettier on the UI(window.alert() is bad practice) ~~
